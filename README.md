Python-Assignments

Most of the files you will see in here are just practice assignments that were very short and direct. There are two projects in particular that were extensive using various modules such as tkinter or sqlite3.



Projects:

- File Transer:
  - This project allows the user to choose transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another. All files that are moved will be saved in a database.

- Phonebook:
  - This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.
